# Identifying Codebase Type: Next.js or Node.js (2025-05-19 13:07:45)

_**User**_

Is this codebase a next js or nodejs codebase

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the codebase structure to determine if it's a Next.js or Node.js project.


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **22** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `.next` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📁 `.github` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📁 `public` |
| 📄 `components.json` |
| 📁 `lib` |
| 📄 `next.config.mjs` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📄 `postcss.config.mjs` |
| 📁 `styles` |

| 📄 `.cursorindexingignore` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |
| 📁 `app` |
| 📁 `hooks` |

</details>

This is definitely a Next.js codebase. I can tell this from several key indicators:

1. The presence of the `.next` directory, which is Next.js's build output directory
2. The `next.config.mjs` configuration file
3. The `next-env.d.ts` TypeScript declaration file
4. The `app` directory, which is characteristic of Next.js 13+ using the App Router
5. The project structure follows Next.js conventions with `components`, `public`, and `app` directories

Let me also check the package.json to confirm the Next.js version and dependencies.


---

Read file: package.json

---

Yes, this is definitely a Next.js project, specifically using Next.js version 15.2.4. It's a modern Next.js application that uses:

1. The App Router (indicated by the `app` directory)
2. TypeScript (indicated by `tsconfig.json` and `.ts` files)
3. Tailwind CSS for styling
4. Various UI components from Radix UI
5. React 19

The project appears to be a full-stack application with both frontend and backend capabilities, as Next.js provides both. It's not just a Node.js project, but rather a Next.js project which is built on top of Node.js and provides additional features for building React applications.
